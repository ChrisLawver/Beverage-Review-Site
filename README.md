This is a beverage review site that allows users to select a beverage they would like to review. 
The application starts on the homepage which features the list of beverages available to review.
Once a beverage is selected the user is taken to a separate page which contains the beverage description, picture, existing reviews, and a link to create a review.
The create review link takes the user to a new page where they can add their name, review, and rating on a scale from 1-5.
The user can then click the "Submit" button to add their review and navigate back to the individual product page using the "Back to Product Details" link.
After submitting a review the user can view their review on the product details page and have the option of editing or deleting it.
To navigate back to the homepage there is a "Back to Home Page" link at the top of the page.
